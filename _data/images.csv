Oshadha Perera_40_CaptSci3.jpg,,"The beach is a good example to show how order and chaos is seen from the tiniest atoms to the biggest structures in nature. At molecular levels, every water molecule is made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms bound by hydrogen bonds. This order is what makes water orderly and dynamic; in a slow stream, it would flow gently, but in a choppy storm, it would crash over rocks and go crazy. On land, the rocks are made up of minerals that go in an orderly structure. When we look at them, we both see the order in the way they cover the beach, but we also see the unique differences in them. This subtle balance of order and chaos is what makes nature exciting and interesting.",Oshadha Perera,teens,Teens,teens

In this photo of a butterfly sucking nectar from a flower, we can see order in everything from the shape, structure, colour, and position of the flower petals to the patterns and structure of the butterfly’s wings, and in the way the pattern on its left wings is exactly replicated on its rights wings. These patterns and colours are not there for no reason; for example, the vibrant colour of the flower helps attract insects pollinate the flowers, and the colour on the butterflies promotes camouflage, and keeps predators away. Sometimes, nature breaks out of this nice orderly box, and mutations in genes create different colours and patterns on butterflies, which can or cannot be helpful based on the butterfly’s habitat and predators - a classic example is the two variations of dark and light Peppered moths.",Oshadha Perera,teenswinner,"First Place, Teens",teens

The web is created in a spiral pattern, keeping the tension constant and the distances constant so it all is in a nice orderly pattern. The web is sticky due to droplets of glue suspended on the silk threads which function as an elastic solid and keeps their victims right where they want them!  The webs can be damaged by the chaotic struggling of trapped insects or due to the force of the wind. On frosty mornings, the web becomes more beautiful but loses its stickiness and starts to break up.",Jeanna Rodgers,adults,Adults,adults
Jeanna Rodgers_25_Jeanna_Wave.JPG,,"Order and chaos are always present in the waves. When energy passes through water it moves in a circular motion. Friction between wind and surface water causes a wave crest as the wind blows across the surface of the water.  The faster and the longer the wind blows, the bigger the waves will grow. Order is shown as the waves will always continue until they are stopped by something like a beach where they break. Sometimes we get massive, freak waves when two storms meet each other and cause chaos around them.

Jeanna Rodgers_24_Jeanna_Football.JPG,,To play football there is a lot of orderly action required in your body.  When you kick the ball you are transferring kinetic energy from your body to the ball.  You need to be able to calculate how much force is required to move the ball with the right speed and in the right direction . The weight of the ball makes a difference - Newton’s second law of motion tells us that a bigger force is required to accelerate a heavy ball than a lighter one. To head the ball there is an inelastic collision where momentum and energy are transferred imperfectly from your head to the ball. Chaos however reigns when not everyone has the ability to send the ball quite where they want it to go!,Jeanna Rodgers,adults,Adults,adults

In the chaos of the arrangement of stars we create pictures with the brightest stars that help us identify them.

Predicting the movement of the lights was very difficult, just like it is difficult to predict the path of a tornado. Everyone ran around the park and some even threw the lights up. The trayectory of the lights show how gravity keeps us all down on the ground, even though the instructions to all were to run and jump as high as possible.

Gilbert van Reenen_16_CumuloNimbusGvanReenen.jpg,,"Towering cumulonimbus clouds encapsulate features of  both  ordered and chaotic states. They are the grandaddies of all clouds and the scariest for aviators.  They often commence as a gentle silent  orderly ascent of a small pocket of warmed air containing a smidgen of water vapour, rising above a ploughed field or car park on a sunny autumn day. The action is triggered by a temperature gradient resulting from uneven absorption of energy from the sun in the central darker area versus  the surrounding lighter zone and can then propagate into a massive anvil shaped,  chaos packed,  structure 21,000 metres above ground level with a base several kilometres diameter. They can produce hail, rain, snow, thunder and lightning and can create extreme turbulence  and destructive  wind gusts at ground level and in surrounding air, posing huge risks for passing aircraft.  Externally they retain regular form and structure and behave predictably.

Gilbert van Reenen_15_MilkyWayGalaxyoverLakeWanaka.jpg,,"Is the Universe ordered or chaotic?  
Great question Uncle Albert!. 
Einstein couldn’t provide an unequivocal answer himself.
Absolute  chaos prevailed for a short time, 10-43  seconds after the BIG Bang.  Apart from a few exceptions, everything settled down nicely for the next13.8 billion years. 
My image  of  the Milky Way, our galaxy  over Wanaka, shows just a small part of the universe. 
Even though the millions of  contained collossal objects individually  have gravitational influence on each other, order somehow prevails.
14,000 years ago this landscape was engulfed in a huge glacier whose momentum created massive chaotic changes to the adjacent rock and dug the lake. 
Much more chaotic though has been the continuing  uplift of the mountains in the background as a consequence of earth’s largest (Pacific) tectonic plate colliding with the neighbouring (Australian) plate, causing a vertical uplift of over  20km and a terrifying sequence of chaotic earthquakes.

Gilbert van Reenen_14_WavesatTeWahiPounamuGilbertvanReenen.jpg,,"Waves are  the most pervasive physical phenomena in the universe. They were generated immediately after the big bang. Evidence of those actual waves can still be detected in space as the cosmic microwave background . There are myriad forms of waves and they can be mathematically defined extremely accurately. Waves are involved in all of our senses and physiological and cognitive processes. 
The propagation of a wave involves both order and chaos because they are initially  a disturbance that then moves in a regular organised manner.  Waves usually involve a medium such as these transverse oceanic waves approaching the Te Wahi Pounamu coast, generated by weather disturbances several thousand kilometers distant in the southern ocean. 
When waves collide with each other or physical barriers e.g  a beachhead or cliff face, the ordered form of the wave is disrupted, then becoming chaotic and  releasing  energy. This can be highly disruptive.

As it falls, the water’s downward movement is shown as blurred streaks during the sixtieth of a second that the camera’s shutter is open. Simultaneously in other parts of the photo the water is seen in sharp detail as turbulent and chaotic. This effect is due to tracking this part of the water’s fall with the camera.

Susi Otto_2_GreenLake.png,,"A chaotic field of ordered frost flowers 
- Green Lake

Frost flowers only grow under very specific conditions: when temperatures first start dropping below the freezing point, the ground is still warm enough to keep the root systems of the plants alive. Plants remain able to draw water from their roots to their stem, but the colder air temperatures make the water freeze. Symmetrical ice crystals start to form inside the stem and push their way out through the stem’s wall. The crystals build up to thin and ordered strands as latent heat is released from crystallization which keeps the water below from freezing. 
A delicate beauty that will be lost once the plant freezes completely in winter.
